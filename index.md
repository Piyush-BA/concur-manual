OVERVIEW

Panasonic Corporation, founded in 1918 as a producer of light bulb sockets and has grown to become one of the largest Japanese electronics producers in the world. With a workforce of over 2.5 lakh (2017 data) employees, it becomes quite some effort to manage and keep track of all the employees manually.
To manage the human capital here at Panasonic, we use the leading human resource management system - SAP Concur.
