## Sign In with username/password
#### Role- User

Login is the first step because it will let the system know that you have the rights to access the system and the system will dynamically change itself based on what kind of user you are.   

Sign In can be done via SSO inside the Panasonic Enviroment.

Steps to Sign In:  

`1.` Open the Sign In page of Concur.

[Sign In page](www.concur.in.panasonic.com){: .btn .btn-blue }
